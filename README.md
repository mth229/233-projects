MTH233 Projects

These are a collection of `IJUlia` notebooks to accompany MTH 233 at the College of Staten Island.

There are 3 projects, each has notes and an accompanying project with questions to answer.

They can be cloned and run on a local jupyter or jupyterhub installation.

They can be used within binder by clicking the link above.

They can be used within `juliabox.com` by using the "Sync" tab.

As with the projects for MTH 229 and MTH 232, the `julia` package, `MTH229.jl`, should be installed, as this has some convenience functions. If not, the projects begin with some longish code blocks to execute.
